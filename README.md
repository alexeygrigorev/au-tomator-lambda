# AuTomator

A Slack moderation bot that runs on AWS Lambda. It lets you moderate from your phone—no laptop, no scanning every channel manually. I built it in June 2022 and have kept adding features as new needs came up.

## Repository layout

The backend is **two independent Lambda projects**, each self-contained with
its own source, build scripts, tests, and dependencies (`uv`). There is no
shared root package — a change to one project never triggers another's CI.

```
.
├── router/        🟢 active  — Slack entry point; routes events       (Test + Deploy Router)
├── automator/     🟢 active  — reaction & FAQ actions                 (Test + Deploy Automator)
└── docs/                     — shared cross-project docs

each project:
  <project>/
  ├── src/            # Lambda code (handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler)
  ├── scripts/        # package.sh, deploy.sh (+ publish.sh for router)
  ├── tests/          # unit tests (+ e2e mocked tests for automator)
  ├── pyproject.toml  # self-contained deps
  ├── uv.lock
  └── README.md
```

CI is per-project and path-filtered (`.github/workflows/test-*.yml` and
`deploy-*.yml`): a project's tests run only when its files change, and each
project deploys only after its own tests pass on `main`.

## How the AuTomator Works

The backend is split into **two Lambdas**, each with a clear responsibility.

### 1. Router — Routes Slack events to the right Lambda

Everything from Slack goes through the router: messages, emoji reactions, and button clicks.

Its only job is to look at the incoming event and quickly decide where it should go next:

| Event | Routed to |
|-------|-----------|
| **Reaction added by admin** | Automator |
| **App mention** | Automator / FAQ Assistant |
| **Message event** | Disabled for now |
| **Button click** (e.g. from an alert) | Acknowledged only |

The router and automator are separate on purpose: Slack expects a response within about 3 seconds. The router responds immediately and invokes the automator asynchronously, so longer work doesn’t time out.

### 2. Automator — Acts based on emoji reactions by the admin and FAQ mentions

This is for fast reaction on spam and other rule violations.

- The bot has a list of **specified emojis** and the **actions** that go with each.
- When you react to any message with one of those emojis, the automator looks up the action and runs it. Actions can be:
  - **Posting a reply** in the thread (e.g. FAQ link, “use threads” reminder).
  - **Deleting the message** and sending a DM to the author explaining why (e.g. rule violation).
  - **Asking an AI** to generate an answer and posting it in the thread (e.g. `:ask-ai:`).
- When anyone tags the bot, the automator can call the Cloudflare FAQ assistant and post the answer in the thread.

Examples:

- **:ask-ai:** — Automator replies in the thread with an AI-generated answer.
- **:rule-book:** (or similar) — Automator deletes the message and DMs the author that it violated community rules and was deleted.

The automator can also send a relevant reply to the author of the message you reacted to, so they get clear feedback.

## Deployment

Each project is self-contained under its own directory (`src/`, `scripts/`,
`tests/`, `pyproject.toml`). CI deploys both projects automatically:
each `Deploy *` workflow runs after its `Test *` workflow passes on `main`, and
only when files under that project changed. Deploy in this order:

**1. Router**

```bash
cd router
bash scripts/publish.sh   # = package.sh + deploy.sh
```

The router Lambda function name is `slack-test`. The GitHub Actions workflow
`.github/workflows/deploy-router.yml` deploys it after `Test Router` passes on
`main`, or manually via workflow dispatch. If the Lambda is renamed later, set
the repository variable `ROUTER_FUNCTION_NAME`; otherwise it defaults to
`slack-test`.

The AWS credentials used by GitHub Actions need `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`,
`lambda:GetFunction`, and `lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration` for `slack-test`.

**2. Automator**

```bash
cd automator
bash scripts/package.sh
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

Deployed by `.github/workflows/deploy-automator.yml` after `Test Automator`
passes on `main`.

## Application Configuration

Behavior is driven by **`automator/src/config.yaml`**, which is in YAML and has three main sections.

### 1. Admins

Slack user IDs of people who can trigger reaction-based actions (e.g. who can use the automator emojis).

```yaml
admins:
  - U01AXE0P5M3
```

### 2. Channels

Maps Slack channel IDs to human-readable names (used for channel-specific messages and placeholders).

```yaml
channels:
  C02R98X7DS9: "course-mlops-zoomcamp"
  C01FABYF2RG: "course-data-engineering"
  C0288NJ5XSA: "course-ml-zoomcamp"
  C06TEGTGM3J: "course-llm-zoomcamp"
```

### 3. Reactions

Each entry defines an emoji (reaction name) and what the automator should do when an admin uses it.

- **Reaction** — The emoji/short name (e.g. `thread`, `faq`, `ask-ai`).
- **Type (or types)** — The kind of action; you can list multiple and they run in sequence.
- **Message / placeholders** — Text to post or send in DMs, with optional placeholders.

#### Reaction types

| Type | What it does |
|------|------------------|
| `SLACK_POST` | Posts a message in the thread (e.g. reminder, link). |
| `DELETE_MESSAGE` | Deletes the message and sends a DM to the author (e.g. rule violation). |
| `ASK_AI` | Calls an AI model, then posts the reply in the thread. |
| `FAQ_ASSISTANT` | Calls the Cloudflare FAQ assistant, then posts the reply in the thread. |
| `REMOVE_BROADCAST` | Removes a “also sent to channel” thread reply from the channel (keeps it in the thread). |
| `REPOST_TO_THREAD_AND_DELETE` | Reposts the message to the thread with a custom message, then deletes it from the channel. |

#### Multiple handlers

Use `types` (a list) to run several actions for one reaction:

```yaml
- reaction: thread
  types:
    - REMOVE_BROADCAST   # First: remove if broadcasted
    - SLACK_POST        # Then: post reminder
  message: "Please use threads..."
```

#### Placeholders

- **Pre-defined:** `{user}`, `{channel}`, `{user_message}` (author, channel, message text).
- **Custom:** e.g. `{link}` — defined under `placeholders` per reaction, often with channel-specific or `default` values.

If a placeholder is channel-specific and the channel isn’t in the map, the `default` value is used when set; otherwise that reaction is skipped for that channel.

#### Example reactions (from config)

| Reaction | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `dont-ask-to-ask-just-ask` | SLACK_POST | Encourage asking questions directly. |
| `be-specific` | SLACK_POST | Ask for exact context, command, error text, and attempted fixes. |
| `thread` | REMOVE_BROADCAST + SLACK_POST | Remove broadcasted reply, post thread reminder. |
| `faq` | FAQ_ASSISTANT | Answer the reacted message with the Cloudflare FAQ assistant. |
| `error-log-to-thread-please` | REPOST_TO_THREAD_AND_DELETE | Move error log to thread, delete from channel. |
| `no-screenshot` | SLACK_POST | Advise against code screenshots; link to guidelines. |
| `no-ai` | SLACK_POST | Point to the AI usage guidelines. |
| `shameless-rules` | DELETE_MESSAGE | Enforce shameless-promo rules; DM author. |
| `jobs-rules` | DELETE_MESSAGE | Enforce job-posting rules; DM author. |
| `ask-ai` | ASK_AI | Generate and post an AI reply in the thread. |

To change behavior, edit `automator/src/config.yaml` and keep the same structure so the application stays compatible.

## FAQ Assistant Integration

Set `FAQ_ASSISTANT_URL` on the automator Lambda:

```bash
FAQ_ASSISTANT_URL=https://<cloudflare-worker>/ask
```

Set the same shared secret on the automator Lambda and the Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
FAQ_ASSISTANT_SHARED_SECRET=...
```

Any user can tag the bot and the router forwards the event to the automator. If `FAQ_ASSISTANT_URL` is unset on the automator Lambda, the automator skips the FAQ assistant request. Reaction events are still forwarded only when the reacting user is an admin.

The automator sends the shared secret as `x-faq-assistant-secret`; the Cloudflare Worker rejects `/ask` calls when its own `FAQ_ASSISTANT_SHARED_SECRET` is set and the header is missing or different.

## Slack App Setup

In Slack app settings, keep the Event Subscriptions request URL pointed at the router:

```text
https://vmnqlq0emg.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/slack
```

Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:

| Event | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| `app_mention` | `app_mentions:read` |
| `reaction_added` | `reactions:read` |

Do not put these under **Subscribe to events on behalf of users**. The router expects events delivered to the bot integration, not user-authorized event streams.

Plain `message` events are disabled for now and are ignored by the router.

The bot also needs to post answers and read reacted messages, so make sure the app has:

```text
chat:write
channels:history
```

For private channels, also add:

```text
groups:history
```

After changing events or scopes, reinstall the Slack app and invite the bot to the course channels where it should answer mentions.
